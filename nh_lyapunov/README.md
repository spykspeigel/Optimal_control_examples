The code follows the closed loop steering of a unicycle based on classic Lyapunov function.
One can refer following paper for further details

'Closed Loop Steering of Unicycle-like Vehicles via Lyapunov Techniques
M. Aicardi, G. Cosalino: â€™

In future I will to add some notes describing the method.
